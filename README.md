# Event Stream

![CI](https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-event-stream/workflows/CI/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-event-stream?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-event-stream/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-event-stream)

## Usage

Event Stream is similar to Unixâ€™s `tail` program, now focused on APM.

Event Stream uses data from `Transaction` and `TransactionError` events to display a live stream of processes occuring in your system.
